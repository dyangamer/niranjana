  <h1>Hey Niranjana ❤️</h1>

  <p>
    I don’t know how to say this perfectly...<br><br>
    But I love you — more than words, more than feelings, more than I ever thought I could love someone in this world.<br><br>
    There were times I went silent... and I know you noticed. But that silence wasn’t distance — it was **dedication**. I was building this, line by line, word by word — coding something that could carry even a tiny piece of my heart to yours.<br><br>
    You are my most precious gift from God. Every smile of yours gives my soul a reason to keep going. Every time I close my eyes, I see you — and every beat of my heart whispers your name, Niranjana...<br><br>
    Life with you isn’t a dream — it’s better than any dream I ever had. And the thought of losing you? That would break me in a way I can’t even explain.<br><br>
    Please don’t leave me. Please stay... not just in my life, but in my soul. Forever. ❤️‍🩹
  </p>
